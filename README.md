# Chloe
Hello! This is Chloe, our new fur pup. She is only 4 months old and has all the typical characteristics of any good puppy out there: playful, cuddly, and lover of all stinky socks. She is pretty great and we are super thankful for your help caring for her!

## What a Normal Day Looks Like
She usually sleeps in our bed and either wakes up when we do or wakes us up to let us know she needs to go to the bathroom. We'll then go for a walk then have her first meal. She eats four times a day with four hours in between and will work around your schedule. 
Typically, when John's working, Chloe will just stay by your side playing with her toys or taking a nap. She will sometimes goes on an evening walk but it's not necessary.

## Separation Anxiety
We are still working on Chloe's separation anxiety but its still definitely a work in progress. She does not like to be left alone and will cry. We try not to acknowledge the small whimpers but also do our best to not let her get to a state of desperation.

#### Practices for Relieving Social Anxiety
These practices are optional for you but in case you wanted to work on these or if her crying is driving you bananas, then you can try doing the following:
1. **Distraction**
	Ex. Chicken flavoring filled Kong, bully stick, puzzle feeder with treats
2. **Calming Spray**
	We put 2 sprays into her crate/bedding right before we do something that would stress her out, like leaving to take out the trash or taking a shower with the door closed.
3. **Desensitizing**
	Walking towards the door or walking around with keys in our hand to help show her that the normal cues for leaving don't always mean we're leaving. If she doesn't cry, then we give her many treats.
## Doing Her Business
Right now, she's still not used to doing her business outside of her artificial grass pee pad but will go anywhere if she can't hold it in (this means the rug, the floor, and sometimes even the bed). Be careful when she poops because she finds them delicious. Try to have a poop bag ready and immediately after she's done pooping tell her to 'Leave It' when she looks at the poop. If she does walk away from it, tell her 'Nice!' and throw a treat in the opposite direction. If she doesn't walk away and tries to eat her poop... be fast.

## Meals
She typically eats four times a day with fours hours in between and will work around your schedule. Try to go on a walk before her first meal. We usually measure how much she needs to eat and will give you portioned sizes to give her. Before you set down the food bowl, tell her to 'Sit'.  Afterwards, tell her to 'Wait' and 'Nice!' while gesturing towards the food after a few seconds. The food will disappear in less than five minutes.

## Walking
She's still in the middle of loose leash training. This means she will tug and try to eat almost everything which includes: napkins, leaves, and even other dog's poop. Tell her to 'Leave It' as soon as she stares at anything that could be harmful to her and pull her away. When she tugs on the leash, you should stop walking until she stops tugging, looks back at you, and walk towards you. Tell her 'Nice!' when she comes back. Just a heads up, depending on how over stimulated she is, she will not take treats.

## Commands
She's still in the middle of learning all of these commands so please be patient with her. Only give her treats (which is 1 treat broken up into smaller pieces) after 2-4 different commands and try not to repeat yourself when she doesn't do the commands. 

If she doesn't perform the command within 5 seconds, turn your back for 10 seconds, then turn to face her, then say the command once more and wait. If she continues to not pay attention, you can opt for a single command like "Touch" or "Sit" then reward her immediately to help relieve her frustration and not associate training with a negative experience.

Verbal Cue | Physical Cue | Expected Action
--- | --- | ---
Nice! | `None` | None - Marker for command followed
Leave It | `Picture Pending` | Will leave alone what she's currently focused on. If it's something harmful and she's not listening, get in between her and the object.
Sit | `Picture Pending` | Sit down
Lay | `Picture Pending` | Lay down with elbows and butt on the ground
Focus | `Picture Pending` | Eye contact held for at least 5 seconds.
Touch | `Picture Pending` | Poke your hand with her nose
Come | `Picture Pending` | Will come to you

## Closing Remarks
Overall, Chloe's a very smart and affectionate dog who just wants to be loved and chased around. We love her very much even though she can be a literal shit eater. 

We can not thank you enough for taking the time to watch over Chloe, so please enjoy everything our humble home has to offer.

Thank you!

Lannie & John
