# Chloe
Hello! This is Chloe, our new fur pup. She is only 4 months old and has all the typical characteristics of any good puppy out there: playful, cuddly, and lover of all stinky socks. She is pretty great and we are super thankful for your help caring for her!

## What a Normal Day Looks Like
She usually sleeps in our bed and either wakes up when we do or wakes us up to let us know she needs to go to the bathroom. We'll then go for a walk then have her first meal. She eat four times a day with four hours in between and will work around your schedule. She sometimes goes on an afternoon walk but it's not necessary.

5:30A | Wake up to pee/poop

## Doing Her Business
Right now, she's still not used to doing her business outside of her artifical grass pee pad but will go anywhere if she can't hold it in (this means the rug, the floor, and sometimes even the bed). Be careful when she poops because she finds them delicious. Try to have a poop bag ready and immediately after she's done pooping tell her to 'Leave It' when she looks at the poop. If she does wake away from it, tell her 'Nice!' and if not... be fast.

## Meals
She typically eats four times a day with fours hours in between and will work around your schedule. Try to go on a walk before her first meal. We usually measure how much she needs to eat and will give you portioned sizes to give her. Before you set down the food bowl, tell her to 'Sit'.  Afterwards, tell her to 'Wait' and 'Nice!' while gesturing towards the food after a few seconds. The food will disappear in less than five minutes.

## Walking
She's still in the middle of loose leash training. This means she will tug and try to eat almost everything which includes: napkins, leaves, and even other dog's poop. Tell her to 'Leave It' as soon as she stares at anything that could be harmful to her and pull her away. When she tugs on the leash, you should stop walking until she stops tugging, looks back at you, and walk towards you. Tell her 'Nice!' when she comes back

## Commands
She's still in the middle of learning all of these commands so please be patient with her. Only give her a treat after 2-4 different commands and try not to repeat yourself when she doesn't do the commands.

Verbal Cue | Physical Cue | Expected Action
--- | --- | ---
Nice! | `None` | None - Marker for command followes
Leave It | `Picture Pending` | Will leave alone what she's currently focused on. If it's something harmful and she's not listening, get in between her and the object.
Sit | `Picture Pending` | Sit down
Lay | `Picture Pending` | Lay down with elbows on the ground
Focus | `Picture Pending` | Watch you
Touch | `Picture Pending` | Poke your hand with her nose
Come | `Picture Pending` | Will come to you
